# Simple Python Word Guessing Game

A classic command-line Hangman-style game built with Python. The program selects a random word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts.

## How to Play
1. The game selects a secret word.
2. You start with **10 attempts**.
3. For every incorrect guess, you lose 1 attempt.
4. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position in the word.
5. Win by uncovering the entire word before your attempts run out!
